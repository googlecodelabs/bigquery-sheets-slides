# Android App Resizing for Chrome OS

## This is not an official Google product

With the ability to run Android on Chromebooks, a huge 
ecosystem of applications and vast new functionality 
is now available to users. While this is great news 
for developers, certain optimizations are required 
to meet usability expectations and to make for an 
excellent user experience. 

One important yet often overlooked area is resizing. 
Android apps on Chrome OS should expect to be rotated, 
maximized, and “free-form” resized multiple times 
throughout their lifecycle. This code lab [link coming soon]
will guide you through implementing some best practices 
to make your app resize robustly and easily.
